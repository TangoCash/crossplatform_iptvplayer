To use IPTVPlayer for KODI, install plugin.video.IPTVplayer.zip plugin in it, like you do for other KODI addons.
The file contains all necessary scripts, nothing else needed.
It will become visible under Vidoe>Addons menu.

The IPTVPlayer addon for KODI has been confirmed to work on Windows, Linux and Android versions of the KODI.
